### Go Conferences 2019

The conference map is [here](http://j.mp/goconmap) and the short link to access it is [j.mp/goconmap](http://j.mp/goconmap). You can use [this service](https://www.latlong.net/convert-address-to-lat-long.html) to get geocodes when adding new conference placemarks to the map. The map data comes from [this kml file](https://vanriper.github.io/goconmap.kml).
