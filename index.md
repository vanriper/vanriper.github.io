### Go Conferences 2019

The conference map is [here](http://j.mp/goconmap) and the short link to access it is [j.mp/goconmap](http://j.mp/goconmap). You can use [this service](https://www.latlong.net/convert-address-to-lat-long.html) to get geocodes when adding new conference placemarks to the map. The map data comes from [this kml file](https://vanriper.github.io/goconmap.kml).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/vanriper/vanriper.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
