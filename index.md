## About Me

Previously, I was a [GDG Community](https://developers.google.com/community/gdg) Advocate from 2011-2014.
From January 2015 through October 2018, I worked in People Development at Google on
mindfulness-based well-being community programs for Google employees. That effort
led to my involvement in the creation of the
[Mindful Workplace Alliance](https://www.mindfulworkplacemovement.com/alliance/) as a
founding member. From November 2018 through December 2019, I was a
a [Go Community](https://golang.org/) Advocate as a member of Google's Open Source
Programs Office (OSPO) working with the awesome [Carmen Andoh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/carmenandoh/).
From January 2020 through August 2022, I did outreach for Google's OSPO managing a 7 figure
annual sponsorship budget for open source projects and foundations.

I left Google in September of 2022 and joined Stellate, a GraphQL Tools Company, in
January of 2023. I am currently the Developer Community Liaison for Stellate. I also
represent Stellate on the governing board for the GraphQL Foundation, the conference committee,
and the community committee.

### GraphQL Conferences

The GraphQL conference map for 2023 is TBD.

### Creating KML Map Files

You can use map markers from the
[Concept211/Google-Maps-Markers Project](https://github.com/Concept211/Google-Maps-Markers).
You can use [this service](https://www.latlong.net/convert-address-to-lat-long.html)
to get geocodes when adding new conference placemarks to the map. You can do basic well formed
XML validation of your KML data files by loading them into your web browser.

### GitHub Pages Support or Contact
